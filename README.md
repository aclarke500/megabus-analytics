# I hate megabus
Megabus is consistently inconsistent, but just how inconsistent are they? This is the question being answered with this. In order to quantify just how late the megabus is, I am building this webscraping automation in order to generate data so we (Onatarians who rely on long distance public transit) can gain insights into how likely things are to be delayed. 

If megabus or anyone has any qualms about this, they can fucking stick it because I wouldn't have had all the time to work on this stupid nonsense if there busses weren't so goddamn late. # megabus-analytics
